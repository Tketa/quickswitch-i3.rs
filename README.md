# Quickswitch i3

Copy of `quickswitch-i3.py` in Rust. The main reason is speed; in Python, a
small delay exists when lauching it, that cause if you type fast enough the
first one or two keypress after that to be ignored. The second reason is to
learn Rust. Feel free to criticize.

Usage is similar to `quickswitch-i3.py`, minus the non-implemented features.
